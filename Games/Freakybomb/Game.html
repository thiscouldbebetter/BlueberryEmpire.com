<h1>FRK-4ZJ Fragmenting Randomized Energetic Anti-enemy Kaboom-tube</h1>
<h1>Operations Manual</h1>

<ol>

<li>Remove the FRK-4ZJ Fragmenting Randomized Energetic Anti-enemy
Kaboom-tube, hereinafter referred to as the "Freakybomb", from its
protective housing.  If protective housing is missing or damaged, wrap
the Freakybomb in damp newspaper and monitor closely for four hours, then
proceed with the next step if no whistling noise is audible.</li><br />

<li>Release safety clamp.  It should make a small but satisfying "thunk" 
noise. If the clamp release makes a "tink" or a "clack" instead of a 
thunk or if the thunk it makes is large or medium rather than small or
if it is in any way unsatisfying, douse the 
Freakybomb with the contents of your canteen and return to step 1.</li><br />

<li>Point Freakybomb toward the enemy, or, at the very least, away from 
the friend.</li><br />

<li>Whisper "I believe in you" into the Freakybomb's encouragement orifice.
Freakybomb may not function correctly without encouragement.</li><br />

<li>Step firmly on the deployment pedal.  It may be necessary to repeat this
operation up to three times to build up the correct pressure.  If the 
Freakybomb does not deploy after three steppings-on, eat an energy bar 
and try two more times.  If it still doesn't deploy, bury the Freakybomb
in hallowed ground and invoke the Rite of Warding (see appendix).</li><br />

<li>Wave goodbye to your problems, for the Freakybomb is likely to end 
them, one way or the other.</li><br />

<li>Burn this manual by dragging its integrated phosphor strip across
a rough rock, perhaps quartz or granite, and swear your co-conspirators 
to secrecy.  Use of the Freakybomb is not technically a war crime in 
most active war zones, since the point of war is to mess [expletive] up.  
But it was really designed to really toe right up to the line, 
if you know what we mean.</li><br />

<li>Rinse hair, if any, thoroughly.  Don't be stingy.  Really hose down 
that scalp.</li><br />

<li>Repeat until further warfare is rendered unnecessary.</li><br />

</ol>
