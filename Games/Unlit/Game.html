<br /><br />

What would you say if I told you that you could travel from New York to 
San Fransisco in under an hour?  
<br/><br />

Most of you would call me a fool or a liar.  
Those few gracious enough to countenance even the mere possibility 
would imagine that I meant to pack them like sardines in the cramped 
belly of some dank and stuffy experimental rocketship, like as 
not to explode during the trip.  And even then, there might be some who
would be glad to accept such a discommodius arrangement in exchange for
such great expedience.
<br /><br />

But even those intrepid few would scoff and jeer when I insisted that, 
no, their journey would be pleasant one, in a air-conditioned and 
soft-cushioned environment, richly appointed, and lacking not the most 
trivial of modern comforts. A kingly place where passengers can recline 
at ease, and perhaps peruse a newspaper or magazine while they wait out 
the short duration of their travel?
<br /><br />

But this and more is possible, with the Bailey T. Farnham Evacu-Tube 
Ultra-Sonic Transit System!

<span style="font-size:300%">How?</span><br />

Some of you may recognize the name Bailey T. Farnham from its association
with the fabulously successful Farnham Drilling Concern, Limited.  For 
decades now, since 1873, Farnham has delved under the hills and dales of America,
bringing our planet's hidden treasures to light, and placing its riches 
in the service of our contrymen.
<br /><br />

It was Farmham drills that helped men gather
the steel to forge the trans-contiental railroad.  Farnham drilled the 
shafts of the mines that provide coal enough to render habitable even 
such far-flung climes as the Yukon territory.  And today, Farnham oil wells 
provide the lifeblood that flows through America's burgeoning fleet of 
auto-mobiles, moving our nation forward into the brighter tomorrow of 
technological progress.
<br /><br />

Our extensive experience with boring and boreholes has placed us in an 
ideal position for the next great leap of human technical prowess.  For 
in our years and years of experience, Farnham has learned how to drill
not just downward, but also slantwise.  And from drilling slantwise, 
it's only a few small degrees to drilling sideways.  And drilling sideways 
is the key.  For it is an inescapable truth that the distances that separate
the great cities of America are horizontal rather than vertical in character.

<span style="font-size:300%">Yes!</span><br />

And so it is that, in the last few years, through a series of fully
legitimate and above-board agreements with state and local governments,  
Farnham has connected the cities of America with a system of 
underground tubes.  But this was only the first step.  The real 
advancement was Farnham's patented
method of evacuating these tubes of air, for air is the enemy of speed.
With the air removed, there are no theoretical and only surmountable 
impediments to man travelling not just faster than a bird can fly, but
faster than a bullet can.
<br /><br />

And so it has indeed become possible to travel from Washington, DC 
to Philadelphia in almost an eyeblink.  From Boston to Atlanta in 
a quarter hour.  And, yes, from New York to San Francisco in forty-five 
minutes.

<span style="font-size:300%">But!</span><br />

Having told you that you can now flit from from city to city at whim, 
what if I told you that cities were obsolete?
<br /><br />

Now that men and women are freed from crawling to place to place over
the dusty surface of our sphere, why continue to cope with the surface
and its attendant ills at all?  Why toil there, sweating under a pitiless
and intemperate sky?  Why shiver there, subject to every draft and the
shadow of each passing cloud?  Why build pitiful walls of sticks and mud
in a vain attempt to shut out the hateful elements?
<br/><br />

Why not join me, and my compatriots, in the welcoming bosom
of Mother Earth?  Why not cast of the shackles of the surface life
and join a new country, a new nation, one closer to the heart of matters,
a land with more to offer than an empty uncaring sky?
<br /><br />

Come below!  Come to Sunlit Grotto!
