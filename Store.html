Fun is fun, but business is business.  The purpose of a business, according 
to our great uncle, is to make money.  This is a business, theoretically.  
You've got money, maybe.  If so, and again, in theory, we want it.</p>

Click on the link below to create an account with us, which will
allow you to give us money in exchange for goods.  Although... are video
games really "goods"?  Maybe they're more like services.  Or, like, licenses?  
To be honest, the traditional economic models break down a little when 
what you're selling is just patterns of electrons, but, by Adam Smith, 
we're going to give it our darnedest.
